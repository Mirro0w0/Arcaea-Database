# Arcaea-Database
Website that plans to store Arcaea Charts informations.

Right now I am working on storing all input data to a database by connecting to a database...
So it is not done

Finished: Inputting data, Calculating Chart potentials, Storing/ Listing charts by Chart potentials, Searching existing charts

**Working On: Editing charts from table, Database Connection, Recent 10 mechanics

Future plan: Listing Best 30/ Recent 10 from Recent 30, HashMap for repetitive Charts...

If you know Javascript or an Arcaea player, I really need your help because this is my first time making my own project!! :D
(This is also my first time using Javascript and I want to know more logics)
